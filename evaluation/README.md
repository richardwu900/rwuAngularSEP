Why was all that showed up for the courseList undefined? For todos, blogs, etc., it all worked perfectly fine, but for courseList it didn't work at all! What the heck!? That ate up over an hour of my time at first, trying to diagnose it before just switching to todos, making "completed" required, "user id" credits, and so on..
