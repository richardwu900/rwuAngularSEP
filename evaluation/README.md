For over the first hour, it just returned undefined when trying to fetch the courseList data, I tried troubleshooting to no avail.

userId    :: Credits    (number)
completed :: Required   (boolean)

title     :: courseName (string)

So please do excuse, it's still fetching data from a json database, and it has all the exact same functionality intended.
